This folder contains the Matlab files to compare LSTM-tGARCH(1,1) with tGARCH(1,1) across 31 global stock stock indexes, 50 large-capital and 50 medium-capital stocks from different countries. 
The analysis consistently shows that the LSTM-tGARCH model outperforms the tGARCH model across various datasets, including stock indexes, large-capital individual stocks, 
medium-capital individual stocks, and portfolios. 
The superior performance of LSTM-tGARCH(1,1) is evident in terms of both in-sample performance (i.e., higher log marginal likelihood) and out-of-sample forecast (i.e., smaller PPS, quantile score and MSE). 
These findings provide strong evidence supporting the superiority of LSTM-tGARCH(1,1) over tGARCH(1,1) for modelling and forecasting stock volatility.

** Instruction on running the empirical study **
1. For stock indexes
- Download and unzip for_stock_index.zip
- Run run_tGARCH_all_stock_index.m and run_RECH_all_stock_index.m to produce the Bayesian inference results for the 31 stock indexes. Then run analyse_stock_index.m to see the comparison. 
The running time can be a few hours depending on the your machine.

2. For the 50 large-captial stocks
- Download file: for individual stocks - largecap.zip
- Run run_tGARCH_all_stock.m and run_RECH_all_stock.m to produce the Bayesian inference results for the stocks. Then run analyse_largecap_stocks.m to see the comparison. 
The running time can be a few hours depending on the your machine.

3. For the 50 medium-captial stocks
- Download file: for individual stocks - midcap.zip
- Run run_tGARCH_all_stock.m and run_RECH_all_stock.m to produce the Bayesian inference results for the stocks. Then run analyse_midcap_stocks.m to see the comparison. 
The running time can be a few hours depending on the your machine.
